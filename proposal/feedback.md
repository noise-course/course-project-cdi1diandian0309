This looks like a pretty interesting project idea and I like that you are focusing on unsupervised methods since that is a very realistic challenge for network data. The writeup shows you have a general plan, but you might want to tighten a few details. For example, the description of which three algorithms you want to compare is still a bit open ended, so naming them would make the plan feel more grounded. Also, the data section is a little broad and could use one or two concrete dataset names since “public unlabeled dataset” can mean a lot of things. Other than these small points, the overall framing makes sense.
